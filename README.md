## Problem Statement:
Given a dataset comprising multiple factors, we aim to determine a fair market value for a used car and predict its resale price. By leveraging multiple variables and typical data associated with used cars, we seek to develop a reliable model that accurately estimates the value of a vehicle based on these factors.

## Motivation:
Every factor we use in the data contributes to an unreasonable resale price for a vehicle (for example: higher mileage often leads to a lower resale price and a vehicle's history, including accidents, title status, and maintenance records, can affect its resale value).
The motivation behind reaching our problem statement of predicting used car resale prices stems from Transparency, Risk Mitigation, Market Optimization, and Efficiency.
By addressing these motivations, our project aims to provide an accurate estimation tool for determining the fair market value of pre-owned vehicles by creating a predictive model that considers the intricacies of the automotive market. 

## Dataset:
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle and focused on the Indian automotive market, comprises 6019 entries and includes resale prices along with key factors deemed significant in the car-buying process, such as mileage and power.

## Model Used: 
1. Random Forest Regression
2. Gradient Boosting Regressor
3. Support Vector Regression
