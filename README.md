Problem Statement:
Given a dataset comprising multiple factors, we aim to determine a fair market value for a used car and predict its resale price. By leveraging multiple variables and typical data associated with used cars, we seek to develop a reliable model that accurately estimates the value of a vehicle based on these factors.

Motivation:
Every factor we use in the data contributes to an unreasonable resale price for a vehicle (example: higher mileage often leads to a lower resale price and a vehicle's history, including accidents, title status, and maintenance records, can affect its resale value).
The motivation behind reaching our problem statement of predicting used car resale prices stems from: Transparency, Risk Mitigation, Market Optimization, Efficiency.
By addressing these motivations, our project aims to provide an accurate estimation tool for determining the fair market value of pre-owned vehicles by creating a predictive model that considers the intricacies of the automotive market. 

Dataset:
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle and focused on the Indian automotive market, comprises 6019 entries and includes resale prices along with key factors deemed significant in the car-buying process, such as mileage and power.
